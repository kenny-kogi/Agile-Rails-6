## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
$ gem install bundler -v 2.2.17
$ bundle _2.2.17_ config set --local without 'production'
$ bundle _2.2.17_ install
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
$ rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
$ rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
$ rails server
```
## Usage

Progmatic Book Store is a web application developed using Rails(backend) and partly ReactJS(Frontend), in my learning path of Agile Rails. The app allows users to shop their favourite Programming Books, add to cart, where they can later place an order and choose different forms of payment.

The administrators of the app, have the capability to login after they register, view the available orders, users, or add more products

## Development

The application is developed using the Test Driven Development methodology, all the system, unit and integration can be found in the Test Folder

## Future Improvements(Very Soon)

Include support of Action Email
